# Lab 1 — Threat Intelligence Fundamentals

**Objective:**  
- Understand the Threat Intelligence (TI) lifecycle  
- Distinguish raw data, information, and actionable intelligence  
- Build an entry-level threat collection → analysis → reporting process

---

## 1. Core Concepts
Threat Intelligence is an analyzed product that helps answer:

| Question | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Who is attacking?** | Threat actor profiling |
| **What are they doing?** | TTP identification |
| **Why are they attacking?** | Motive and target mapping |
| **How do we respond?** | Defensive and strategic insights |

**TI Value Pyramid:**
Raw Data → Processed Information → Analyzed Intelligence → Actionable Insights

## 2. TI Lifecycle
1. **Direction** — Define intelligence goals  
2. **Collection** — Gather data from trusted sources  
3. **Processing** — Normalize and enrich data  
4. **Analysis** — Identify patterns and derive insights  
5. **Dissemination** — Deliver findings in a clear report  
6. **Feedback** — Improve intelligence requirements

## 3. Practical Task
### Task 1 — Threat Classification
Read the threat descriptions below and label them as:

- `Raw Data`
- `Information`
- `Actionable Intelligence`

| Description | Label |
|---|---|
| A list of 200 suspicious IP addresses | ? |
| A blog stating a new ransomware targets universities | ? |
| A report concluding universities are targeted via phishing emails with macro documents, recommending email filtering rules | ? |

### Expected Answer:
Raw Data | Information | Actionable Intelligence

### Task 2 — Intelligence Summary
Write a 120–150 word intelligence summary based on this scenario:

> A threat actor group is increasingly targeting Southeast Asian educational institutions using credential-harvesting pages impersonating cloud service portals. Attack peaks during enrollment periods. Most victims interacted via mobile devices. Intelligence suggests improving identity verification pages and anomaly detection for mass login attempts.

**Requirements:**  
✔ Clear findings  
✔ Risk impact explanation  
✔ Defensive recommendation
