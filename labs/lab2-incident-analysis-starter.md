- Produce a concise incident summary report

---

## 1. Scenario
> A student reports that their school account sent spam emails without authorization. Logs show login attempts from multiple regions within a 15-minute window, followed by outbound email activity. No password reset was triggered.

---

## 2. Hypothesis Development
Create 3 possible hypotheses explaining the incident:

1. **H1:** ?

3. **H3:** ?

For each hypothesis, assign:
- Likelihood (High / Medium / Low)
- Required evidence to validate
- Potential impact if true

## 3. Event Correlation Table
Build an event correlation table like this:

| Time | Event | Indicator Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 08:10 | Login attempt from unusual region | ? | ? |
| 08:12 | Multiple failed logins | ? | ? |
| 08:15 | Outbound spam email batch | ? | ? |
