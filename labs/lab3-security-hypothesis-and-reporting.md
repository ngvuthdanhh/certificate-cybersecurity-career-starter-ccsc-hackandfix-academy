# Lab 3 — Security Hypothesis & Research Reporting

**Objective:**  
- Practice security hypothesis creation  
- Convert assumptions into testable statements  
- Produce a research-style security report

---

## 1. Hypothesis Writing
Convert the following assumptions into security hypotheses:

| Assumption | Hypothesis |
|---|---|
| Users reuse weak passwords | ? |
| Public Wi-Fi increases compromise risk | ? |
| Attackers exploit seasonal user behavior | ? |

A valid hypothesis should be:
[Condition] → [Threat behavior] → [Security impact] → [Testable outcome]

---

## 2. Mini Research Task
Choose **one** hypothesis above and:

1. Define how you would test it  
2. List 2 expected indicators if hypothesis is correct  
3. Explain the impact on an organization (education sector if possible)  
4. Provide a 100-word recommendation section

---

## 3. Security Report Output
Deliver a short academic security report using this format:

Hypothesis:
Test method:
Expected indicators:
Impact assessment:
Recommendations:

---

## 4. Bonus (Optional)
Add a **confidence rating** section using:
- Evidence quality
- Source credibility
- Correlation strength
- Time relevance
