## 📝 Personal Review

The course helped me reinforce fundamental knowledge and build practical security thinking.

### Key takeaways:
- **Security is not only about attacking, but validating hypotheses and evaluating risks**
- **Understanding threat context matters more than relying on tools**
- **Incident Response must be structured, logical, and evidence-driven**
- **Social Engineering is the most dangerous vector because it exploits humans, not systems**
- **A strong Red Team operator is someone who can propose mitigation, not just exploit**

### Skills improved after the course:
- Threat collection & evaluation
- Incident analysis and timeline building
- Security hypothesis verification report writing
- Building basic defense checklists for users and organizations

This is an excellent **starter program for anyone aiming to enter InfoSec with a Red Team or Security Research direction**, especially for those who want to dive into security logic instead of tool-based learning.
