# 03 — Phishing & Social Engineering

Phishing is one of the most effective attack vectors because it targets **humans**, not firewalls.

## 🎣 Phishing Anatomy
1. **Lure** — The bait (fake alert, job offer, invoice, warning)
2. **Pretext** — The story that makes the email believable
3. **Hook** — A link, file, or request for action
4. **Payload** — Credential harvest, malware, or sensitive data theft
5. **Follow-through** — Next stages of compromise

## 🧠 Social Engineering Techniques
- Authority impersonation
- Urgency pressure
- Scarcity manipulation
- Emotional leverage (fear, curiosity, reward)
- Familiar branding mimicry

## Red Flags Checklist
- Unexpected attachments
- Mismatched sender domains
- Grammar inconsistency vs. brand reputation
- Over-urgent tone
- Requests for credentials or sensitive data
