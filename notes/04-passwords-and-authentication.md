# 04 — Password Security & Authentication

Password attacks remain dominant due to weak complexity policies, password reuse, and predictable patterns.

## 🔐 Password Attack Types
| Attack | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Brute Force | Trying all possible combinations |
| Dictionary Attack | Using common password lists |
| Credential Stuffing | Reusing leaked credentials |
| Pattern Guessing | Exploiting human predictability |

## Authentication Basics
- **Single-Factor** → Only password
- **Two-Factor (2FA)** → Password + second proof
- **MFA** → Multiple layered verification
- **Password Policies** → Complexity, rotation, blacklist rules

## What Makes a Password Strong?
- Length > complexity
- No personal info
- No reuse across services
- Not in breach-leaked lists
- Random, not patterned

---

> A password policy is only as strong as its weakest user habit.
